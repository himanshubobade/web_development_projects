											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(1) Read the syllabus -</strong> Syllabus of UPSC is an important document. Reading and remembering it thoroughly is crucial. Every news or event must knock in your mind the entry in the syllabus it is related to. It will help you understand the context of any information. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(2) Read NCERT -</strong> Read NCERT again, then Again, Again and Again - NCERTs form the most fundamental component of preparation. Being thorough with NCERTs is essential to crack UPSC.   To rephrase Rumi - UPSC preparation is like making dough, you keep doing the same thing again and again until you realize that it done.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(3) Read newspaper -</strong> Newspaper reading daily may seem like a monotonous exercise. But reading newspaper smartly (to have read the syllabus will help you filter out irrelevant content) is essential.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(4) Basics of all subjects are important -</strong> UPSC is dynamic, questions asked cover a whole gamut of subjects. No one or two topics alone will let you crack the exam. So, you need to understand the basics of each subject. Standard texts must be referred here.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(5) Analysis, Correlation and Linkages -</strong> UPSC syllabus is designed to provide you an understanding of how the world, the society, the State works. So, studying any subject in isolation leaves your understanding superficial and incomplete. Try to link and correlate what you study in books with the events in the news and daily life. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(6) Example -</strong> For example, corona virus scare can be linked to several subjects of study from the syllabus - biology and science & technology, economy, globalisation, security issues, public health infrastructure, disaster management, etc. It provides a ready template to cover any topic. Reading the basics from the standard will make the foundations of your understanding sound.</p>

											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(1) Make a plan -</strong> Consult teachers or mentors before charting out a plan for yourself and stick to the plan. Otherwise, it is like setting the sail into the sea without a compass - Sooner or later, you will sink !</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(2) Set achievable targets -</strong> Achievable targets provide a useful rule to test your own progress. Achieving those targets further motivates you starting a virtuous cycle of performance.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(3) Keep a track of your progress -</strong> Make a diary or use an app like OneNote, Excel, to keep a track of the progress on reading, practice tests, weaknesses and strengths, etc. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(4) First rule of intelligent tinkering is to keep all the pieces -</strong> UPSC does not test the aspirants at a Doctorate level, so one need not go into the deep details of every issue. Covering all the subjects is very important. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(5) If in doubt, ask ! It is okay. -</strong> Doing the same thing and expecting different result is not a good approach. So, if you are weak in some area, seek appropriate guidance. It is okay to ask, no one is perfect in all subjects.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(6) Practice tests and examination temperament -</strong> Examination temperament is an important aspect. Not everyone has the temperament to sit for 2 full hours and deliver her/his own best. So, before jumping into the actual exam, do practice and practice regularly. Start practicing a weekly test 12 weeks before the exam. Make it 2 tests per week as the exam approaches. Do it sincerely mimicing real exam environment and check for your strengths and weaknesses.</p>

											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(1) Be disciplined -</strong> UPSC preparation is a marathon, not a sprint. So, do well today, and do it daily.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(2) Talk to friends, teachers and mentors -</strong> It is always good to confide to friends and teachers your challenges and issues. UPSC preparation is a high pressure task. But it can be handled well if we recognise it as a part of the preparation of everyone.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(3) Relax and exercise -</strong> take care of your health, exercise regularly. UPSC preparations take consistent efforts for months. Staying fit emotionally and physically is crucial to deliver to your ability in actual exam.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>(4) ENJOY -</strong> No endeavour in life can be successful unless you are enjoying it. Believe it - you are working for something good, meaningful and aspirational. So, enjoy ! </p>

											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>a. Studying for 16 hours -</strong> NO - 16 hours cannot be sustained for weeks, months. This approach is not sustainable and leads to frustration after you start missing targets. It can also negatively impact your health. It is strictly not recommended.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>b. Check for new materials in the market -</strong> Markets are full of material of dubious quality. So, consult your teachers and mentors to select the right material. Time is too precious to waste it on poor material and find it out for yourself that it should not be done.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>c. Doing tests without analysis -</strong> Doing tests mechanically without analysing for your weaknesses, mistakes, gaps is a colossal waste of time. Each test is an opportunity to improve and learn and must be taken accordingly.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="bg-white p-15 border-radius-5 mb-15">
											<p class="font-16 line-height-30"><strong>d. Reading too much without reflection -</strong> Reading out too much content without internalising or reflecting on it is a bad strategy any day. Reading limited material but developing ability to "produce your knowledge in examination environment in a structured manner" - is what is required. Reading too much can easily give a "feel good" without improving your real performance.</p>
